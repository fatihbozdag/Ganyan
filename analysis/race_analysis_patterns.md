### Key Performance Patterns

1. Form Indicators Impact
- DB SKG SK: Strong positive correlation (winner)
- SK alone: Good indicator (2nd place)
- K DB: Moderate performance (4th place)
- Form more important than barrier position

2. Starting Position Impact
- Wide barriers (8,9) can win with class
- Inside barrier advantage less significant than expected
- Middle barriers (4-7) showed mixed results

3. EİD (Odds) Reliability
- Top 2 favorites finished 1-2 (but in reverse order)
- Clear correlation between EİD and performance
- Sub-10 EİD horses all finished in top 6

4. Time Gaps Analysis
- 1st to 2nd: 0.17s
- 2nd to 3rd: 0.47s
- 3rd to 4th: 1.81s
- Clear class divisions in the field

5. Weight Impact
- Standard weights performed better
- Weight penalties showed negative correlation
- Filly allowance (56kg) advantage not significant

6. Breeding Impact
- International breeding strong (USA, IRE)
- BODEMEISTER (USA) progeny performed well
- MASAR (IRE) progeny also strong

### Prediction System Updates

1. Priority Factors (High to Low)
- Form designations (especially multiple indicators)
- EİD (odds) under 10.0
- International breeding
- Jockey experience
- Base weight (no penalties)
- Barrier position

2. Red Flags
- Weight penalties over +0.20
- No form designations
- EİD over 20.0
- Wide barriers without class indicators

3. Time Standards
- Class 1: Under 1:30.00
- Class 2: 1:30.00-1:32.00
- Class 3: 1:32.00-1:34.00
- Class 4: Over 1:34.00

## Notes for Future Predictions
1. Value form designations more heavily
2. Don't overvalue barrier position
3. Consider time standards for class assessment
4. Watch for international breeding
5. Monitor jockey-trainer combinations
6. Track weight penalty impact
